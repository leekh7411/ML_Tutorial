%NNCOSTFUNCTION Implements the neural network cost function for a two layer
%neural network which performs classification
%   [J grad] = NNCOSTFUNCTON(nn_params, hidden_layer_size, num_labels, ...
%   X, y, lambda) computes the cost and gradient of the neural network. The
%   parameters for the neural network are "unrolled" into the vector
%   nn_params and need to be converted back into the weight matrices. 
% 
%   The returned parameter grad should be a "unrolled" vector of the
%   partial derivatives of the neural network.
%

% Reshape nn_params back into the parameters Theta1 and Theta2, the weight matrices
% for our 2 layer neural network
Theta1 = reshape(nn_params(1:hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)), ...
                 hidden_layer_size, (input_layer_size + 1));

Theta2 = reshape(nn_params((1 + (hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1))):end), ...
                 num_labels, (hidden_layer_size + 1));

% Setup some useful variables
m = size(X, 1);
         
% You need to return the following variables correctly 
J = 0;
Theta1_grad = zeros(size(Theta1));
Theta2_grad = zeros(size(Theta2));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: You should complete the code by working through the
%               following parts.
%
% Part 1: Feedforward the neural network and return the cost in the
%         variable J. After implementing Part 1, you can verify that your
%         cost function computation is correct by verifying the cost
%         computed in ex4.m


J_func = @(_a,_y) ((-1 * _y) .* log(_a) - (1 - _y) .* log(1 - _a));
H_func = @(_x) (sigmoid(Theta2 * [1;sigmoid(Theta1 * [1;_x'])])); %'

for i = 1:m
	vec_y = zeros(num_labels,1);
	vec_y(y(i)) = 1;
	rst = J_func(H_func(X(i,:)),vec_y);
	rst = sum(rst);
	J = J + rst;
end
J = J / m;

% Regularization !
reg_Theta1 = Theta1;
reg_Theta2 = Theta2;
reg_Theta1(:,1) = zeros(size(reg_Theta1(:,1)));
reg_Theta2(:,1) = zeros(size(reg_Theta2(:,1)));

J = J + lambda/(2*m) * (sum(sum(reg_Theta1 .^2)) + sum(sum(reg_Theta2 .^2))); 
 

% Part 2: Implement the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradients
%         Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad. You should return the partial derivatives of
%         the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2 in Theta1_grad and
%         Theta2_grad, respectively. After implementing Part 2, you can check
%         that your implementation is correct by running checkNNGradients
%
%         Note: The vector y passed into the function is a vector of labels
%               containing values from 1..K. You need to map this vector into a 
%               binary vector of 1's and 0's to be used with the neural network
%               cost function.
%
%         Hint: We recommend implementing backpropagation using a for-loop
%               over the training examples if you are implementing it for the 
%               first time.

for i = 1:m
  a1 = X(i,:);
  a1 = [1;a1'];
  z2 = Theta1 * a1;
  a2 = sigmoid(z2);
  a2 = [1;a2];
  z3 = Theta2 * a2;
  a3 = sigmoid(z3);
  vec_y = zeros(num_labels,1);
  vec_y(y(i)) = 1;
  d3 = a3 - vec_y;
  d2 = (Theta2)' * d3;
  d2 = d2(2:end); % skipped the bias data
  d2 = d2 .* sigmoidGradient(z2);
  Theta2_grad = Theta2_grad + d3 * (a2)';
  Theta1_grad = Theta1_grad + d2 * (a1)';
end

Theta1_grad = Theta1_grad / m;
Theta2_grad = Theta2_grad / m;


% Part 3: Implement regularization with the cost function and gradients.
%
%         Hint: You can implement this around the code for
%               backpropagation. That is, you can compute the gradients for
%               the regularization separately and then add them to Theta1_grad
%               and Theta2_grad from Part 2.
%

Theta1_grad = Theta1_grad + (lambda/m) * reg_Theta1;
Theta2_grad = Theta2_grad + (lambda/m) * reg_Theta2;
